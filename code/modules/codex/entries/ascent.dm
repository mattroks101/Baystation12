	lore_text = "The Ascent is some form of stellar civilization, settlement or entity known to \
	the Skrell. It has been referred to several times over the course of Human-Skrell history, \
	usually accidentally or offhandedly, or over channels humans were not expected to have access \
	to. The Skrell as a whole refuse to speak about it, even when asked directly, and generally \
	refer any inquiries to their superiors, who then in turn refer the question to others. What \
	little information that has been extracted from the bureaucratic quagmire of the Qerr-Katish \
	follows:<br><br><li> \
	<ul>They are technologically advanced.</ul> \
	<ul>They are difficult to communicate with.</ul> \
	<ul>They are currently disinterested in humanity.</ul> \
	<ul>They consume their own kind.</ul> \
	</li><br> \
	Specifics are hard to come by and even harder to verify. If you think you have hard evidence or \
	information relating to the Ascent, please contact the Codex offices, Venus orbit, for monetary reward."
	mechanics_text = "The Ascent are a hostile insectoid culture neighboring the Skrell. \
	So far, humanity hasn't managed to learn anything of note about them, and the Qerr-Katish \
	are interested in keeping things that way to avoid an interstellar diplomatic incident. \
	The average Skrell citizen knows that the Ascent are vicious, easily provoked, and stand \
	roughly on par with Skrellian technology. They are also aware that telling the humans about \
	the Ascent is an extremely bad idea, and is strongly discouraged."
